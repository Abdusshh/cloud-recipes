# Cloud Recipes

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The app allows users to input ingredients they have and generate recipes using [Google’s Gemini](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/gemini) API. Users can also store their favorite recipes and search for them later.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action. The page will auto-update as you make changes to `app/page.tsx`.

### Key Project Features:
- **Recipe Generation:** Users can input ingredients, and the app generates recipes using Google’s Gemini API.
- **Recipe Storage:** Users can save their favorite recipes.
- **Search:** Users can search for saved recipes.
